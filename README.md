# Realtime-cryptoprice-tracker
This is a simple Crypto Price Tracker web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML file creates the structure of the app, including a title, subtitle, and a grid section to display cryptocurrency prices. The CSS file (crypto.css) is used to design a clean and modern layout with styled crypto cards, proper spacing, and responsive design for better viewing on different devices. The JavaScript file (crypto.js) adds functionality by fetching real-time cryptocurrency data from an external API and displaying details such as coin name, current price, and price changes dynamically inside the grid. This project demonstrates basic concepts like API integration, DOM manipulation, dynamic data rendering, and creating a simple real-time dashboard interface.
